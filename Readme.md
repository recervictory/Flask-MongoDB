# Flask MongoDB and Dockerizations

This document is a comprehensive tutorial on how to use MongoDB in a Flask application. It is designed to help developers who are new to Flask and MongoDB to create a web application that interacts with a MongoDB database.

**The tutorial covers the following steps in detail:**

1. Setting up PyMongo and Flask: This step involves creating a virtual environment and installing Flask and PyMongo using pip. It also includes creating a database in MongoDB with a collection.
2. Connecting to the MongoDB server and creating a collection: In this step, users will learn how to connect to the MongoDB server and create a collection for storing data.
3. Creating a web page for adding and displaying todos: This step involves creating a web page that allows users to add and display todos. Users will learn how to handle POST requests and display data from the database on the web page.
4. Deleting todos: In this step, users will learn how to add a delete button to the web page and handle the delete request in Flask. Users will also learn how to use the `ObjectId()` class to convert string IDs to ObjectId objects.
5. Configuring for Dockerization (optional): This step is optional and covers how to configure the Flask application for Dockerization. Users will learn how to modify the configurations file to connect to a Dockerized MongoDB container and how to run the Flask application with `python -u app.py`.

Overall, this tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to use MongoDB in a Flask application, making it easy for developers to create a fully-functional web application with a database backend.
